It also includes an option to check a file’s status on VirusTotal, a site that performs automated file scanning against over 40 antivirus engines, and an option to upload a file for scanning.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Use Case</span>:	<strong>Check for unsigned files in C:\Windows\System32.</strong><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>:	<strong>sigcheck -u -e C:\Windows\System32 -accepteula</strong><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Parameter usage</span>:<br />• -u &quot;If VirusTotal check is enabled, show files that are unknown by VirusTotal or have non-zero detection, otherwise show only unsigned files.&quot;<br />• -e &quot;Scan executable images only (regardless of their extension)&quot;<br /><br /><br /><strong>Streams</strong><br /><br />&quot;The NTFS file system provides applications the ability to create alternate data streams of information. By default, all data is stored in a file&#39;s main unnamed data stream, but by using the syntax &#39;file:stream&#39;, you are able to read and write to alternates.&quot; (official definition)<br /><br />Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System). Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA) and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively Window Explorer doesn&#39;t display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files.<br /><br />Malware writers have used ADS to hide data in an endpoint, but not all its uses are malicious. When you download a file from the Internet unto an endpoint, there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that it was downloaded from the Internet.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>: <strong>streams &lt;File_Name&gt;</strong><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example:</span><br />	<img src="images/265-1.png" alt="images/265-1.png" /><br />The above command displays all the streams pertaining the FIle_Name<br /><br /><strong>SDelete</strong><br /><br /><strong>SDelete</strong> is a command line utility that takes a number of options.
