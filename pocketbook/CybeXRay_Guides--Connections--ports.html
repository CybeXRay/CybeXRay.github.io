<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>ports</h1><br/>Port 135:<br />The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service supports communication between Windows<br />applications. Specifically, the service implements the RPC protocol — a low-level form<br />of inter-process communication where a client process can make requests of a server<br />process. Microsoft’s foundational COM and DCOM technologies are built on top of RPC.<br />The service’s name is RpcSs and it runs inside the shared services host process,<br />svchost.exe. This is one of the main processes in any Windows operating system &amp; it<br />should not be terminated.<br /><br />Port 139:<br />This port is used for NetBIOS. NetBIOS is an acronym for Network Basic Input/Output<br />System. It provides services related to the session layer of the OSI model allowing<br />applications on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. As<br />strictly an API, NetBIOS is not a networking protocol. Older operating systems ran<br />NetBIOS over IEEE 802.2 and IPX/SPX using the NetBIOS Frames (NBF) and NetBIOS over<br />IPX/SPX (NBX) protocols, respectively. In modern networks, NetBIOS normally runs over<br />TCP/IP via the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) protocol. This results in each computer in the<br />network having both an IP address and a NetBIOS name corresponding to a (possibly<br />different) host name. NetBIOS is also used for identifying system names in<br />TCP/IP(Windows).<br />Simply saying, it is a protocol that allows communication of files and printers through<br />the Session Layer of the OSI Model in a LAN.<br /><br />Port 445:<br />This port is used for the SMB. SMB is a network file sharing protocol that requires an<br />open port on a computer or server to communicate with other systems. SMB ports are<br />generally port numbers 139 and 445. Port 139 is used by SMB dialects that communicate<br />over NetBIOS. It&#39;s a session layer protocol designed to use in Windows operating<br />systems over a local network. Port 445 is used by newer versions of SMB (after Windows<br />2000) on top of a TCP stack, allowing SMB to communicate over the Internet. This also<br />means you can use IP addresses in order to use SMB like file sharing.<br />Simply saying, SMB has always been a network file sharing protocol. As such, SMB<br />requires network ports on a computer or server to enable communication to other<br />systems. SMB uses either IP port 139 or 445.</div>
