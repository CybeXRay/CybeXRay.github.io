<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Registry Viewing Tools</h1><br/><strong><h1>Registry Viewing Tools</h1></strong><br /><br /><br />Once we have extracted the registry hives, we need a tool to view these files as we would in the <strong>registry editor</strong>. Since the registry editor only works with live systems and can&#39;t load exported hives, we can use the following tools:<br /><br /><strong><h2>Tools:</h2></strong><br /><br /><strong><h3>Registry Viewer:</h3></strong><br />As we can see in the screenshot below, <a href="https://accessdata.com/product-download/registry-viewer-2-0-0">AccessData&#39;s Registry Viewer</a> has  a similar user interface to the Windows Registry Editor. There are a  couple of limitations, though. It only <strong>loads one hive at a time</strong>, and it  <strong>can&#39;t take the transaction logs</strong> into account.<br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Zimmerman&#39;s Registry Explorer:</h3></strong><br />(<a href="https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md">https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md</a>)<br /><br />Eric Zimmerman has developed a handful of <a href="https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md">tools</a>  that are very useful for performing Digital Forensics and Incident  Response. One of them is the Registry Explorer. It <strong>can load multiple hives simultaneously</strong> and <strong>add data from transaction logs</strong> into the hive to make a more &#39;cleaner&#39; hive with more  up-to-date data. It also has a handy &#39;Bookmarks&#39; option containing  forensically important registry keys often sought by forensics  investigators. Investigators can go straight to the interesting registry  keys and values with the bookmarks menu item. We will explore these in  more detail in the upcoming tasks.<br /><br /><strong><h3>RegRipper:</h3></strong><br /><a href="https://github.com/keydet89/RegRipper3.0">RegRipper</a>  is a utility that takes a registry hive as input and outputs a report  that extracts data from some of the forensically important keys and  values in that hive. The output report is in a text file and shows all  the results in sequential order.Â <br />RegRipper is available in both a CLI and GUI form<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> One shortcoming of RegRipper is that it <strong>does not take the transaction logs </strong>into account. We must use <strong>Registry Explorer</strong> to <strong>merge transaction logs with the respective registry hives</strong> before sending the output to  RegRipper for a more accurate result.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
