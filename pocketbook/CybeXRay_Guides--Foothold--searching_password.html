<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>searching password</h1><br/>Lateral Movement<br />As user www-data we can&#39;t achieve many things as the role has restricted access on the system. Since the<br />website is making use of PHP and SQL we can enumerate further the web directory for potential disclosures<br />or misconfigurations. After some search we can find some interesting php files under /var/www/html/cdn-<br />cgi/login directory. We can manually review the source code of all the pages or we can try search for<br />interesting strings with the usage of grep tool. grep is a tool that searches for PATTERNS in each FILE and<br />print lines that match the patterns. We can use cat * to read all files while pipeing the output to grep<br />where we provide the pattern of a string that starts with the word passw and followed by any string such as<br />for example words passwd or password. We can also use the switch -i to ignore case sensitive words like<br />Password.<br /><br />cat * | grep -i passw*<br /><br /><a href=""><img src="images/31-1.png" alt="images/31-1.png" /></a></div>
