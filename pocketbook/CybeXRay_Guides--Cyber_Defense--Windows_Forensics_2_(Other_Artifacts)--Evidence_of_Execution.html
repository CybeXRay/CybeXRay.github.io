This stored information is used to load the program quickly in case of frequent use. This information is stored in prefetch files which are located in the <strong>C:\Windows\Prefetch</strong> directory.<br /><br />Prefetch files have an extension of &quot;<strong>.pf</strong>&quot;. Prefetch files contain the last run times of the application, the number of times the application was run, and any files and device handles used by the file. Thus it forms an excellent source of information about the last executed programs and files.<br /><br />We can use Prefetch Parser (PECmd.exe) from Eric Zimmerman&#39;s tools for parsing Prefetch files and extracting data.<br /><br /><br />To run Prefetch Parser on a file and save the results in a CSV, we can use the following command:<br /><br /><strong>PECmd.exe -f &lt;path-to-Prefetch-files&gt; --csv &lt;path-to-save-csv&gt;</strong><br /><br />Similarly, for parsing a whole directory, we can use the following command:<br /><br /><strong>PECmd.exe -d &lt;path-to-Prefetch-directory&gt; --csv &lt;path-to-save-csv&gt;</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><br /></strong><strong><h3>Windows 10 Timeline</h3></strong><br /><br />Windows 10 stores recently used applications and files in an SQLite database called the Windows 10 Timeline. This data can be a source of information about the last executed programs. It contains the application that was executed and the <strong>focus time</strong> of the application. The Windows 10 timeline can be found at the following location:<br /><br /><strong>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\{randomfolder}\ActivitiesCache.db</strong><br /><br />We can use Eric Zimmerman&#39;s WxTCmd.exe for parsing Windows 10 Timeline.<br /><br /><br />We can use the following command to run WxTCmd:<br /><br /><strong>WxTCmd.exe -f &lt;path-to-timeline-file&gt; --csv &lt;path-to-save-csv&gt;</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Windows Jump Lists</h3></strong><br /><br />Windows introduced jump lists to help users go directly to their recently used files from the taskbar. We can view jumplists by right-clicking an application&#39;s icon in the taskbar, and it will show us the recently opened files in that application. This data is stored in the following directory:<br /><br /><strong>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations</strong><br /><br />Jumplists include information about the applications executed, first time of execution, and last time of execution of the application against an AppID.<br /><br />We can use Eric Zimmerman&#39;s JLECmd.exe to parse Jump Lists.<br />We can use the following command to parse Jumplists using JLECmd.exe:<br /><br /><strong>JLECmd.exe -f &lt;path-to-Jumplist-file&gt; --csv &lt;path-to-save-csv&gt;</strong></div>
