<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Impacket Toolkit</h1><br/>Impacket is a collection of Python classes for working with network protocols. Impacket<br />is focused on providing low-level programmatic access to the packets and for some<br />protocols (e.g. SMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself. Packets can be<br />constructed from scratch, as well as parsed from raw data, and the object oriented API<br />makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set<br />of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket">https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket</a><br /><br /><br />A quick installation guide is provided before we can use it.<br /><br />git clone <a href="https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git">https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket.git</a><br />cd impacket<br />pip3 install .<br /><br /># OR:<br /><br />sudo python3 setup.py install<br /><br /><br /># In case you are missing some modules:<br />pip3 install -r requirements.txt<br /><br /><br />Note: In case you don&#39;t have pip3 (pip for Python3) installed, or Python3, install it with the following commands:<br />sudo apt install python3 python3-pip<br /><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">THM Impacket Installation</span></strong><br /><br />Impacket releases have been unstable since 0.9.20 I suggest getting an installation of Impacket &lt; 0.9.20<br /><br />1.) cd /opt navigate to your preferred directory to save tools in <br />2.) download the precompiled package from https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/releases/tag/impacket_0_9_19<br />3.) cd Impacket-0.9.19 navigate to the impacket directory<br />4.) pip install . - this will install all needed dependencies<br /></div>
