It also includes an option to check a file’s status on VirusTotal, a site that performs automated file scanning against over 40 antivirus engines, and an option to upload a file for scanning.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Use Case</span>:	<strong>Check for unsigned files in C:\Windows\System32.</strong></p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>:	<strong>sigcheck -u -e C:\Windows\System32 -accepteula</strong></p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Parameter usage</span>:</p><p>• -u &quot;If VirusTotal check is enabled, show files that are unknown by VirusTotal or have non-zero detection, otherwise show only unsigned files.&quot;</p><p>• -e &quot;Scan executable images only (regardless of their extension)&quot;</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Streams</strong></p><p></p><p>&quot;The NTFS file system provides applications the ability to create alternate data streams of information. By default, all data is stored in a file&#39;s main unnamed data stream, but by using the syntax &#39;file:stream&#39;, you are able to read and write to alternates.&quot; (official definition)</p><p></p><p>Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is a file attribute specific to Windows NTFS (New Technology File System). Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA) and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively Window Explorer doesn&#39;t display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files.</p><p></p><p>Malware writers have used ADS to hide data in an endpoint, but not all its uses are malicious. When you download a file from the Internet unto an endpoint, there are identifiers written to ADS to identify that it was downloaded from the Internet.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>: <strong>streams &lt;File_Name&gt;</strong></p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example:</span></p><p>	<img src="images/265-1.png" alt="images/265-1.png" /></p><p>The above command displays all the streams pertaining the FIle_Name</p><p></p><p><strong>SDelete</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>SDelete</strong> is a command line utility that takes a number of options.
