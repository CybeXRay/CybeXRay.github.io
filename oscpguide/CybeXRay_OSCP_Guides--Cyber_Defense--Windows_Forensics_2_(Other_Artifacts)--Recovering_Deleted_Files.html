As we learned in the previous two tasks, a file system stores the location of a file on the disk in a table or a database. When we delete a file from the file system, the file system deletes the entries that store the file&#39;s location on the disk. For the file system, the location where the file existed is now available for writing or unallocated. However, the file contents on disk are still there, as long as they are not overwritten by the file system while copying another file or by the disk firmware while performing maintenance on the disk.<br /><br />Similarly, there is data on the disk in different unallocated clusters, which can possibly be recovered. To recover this data, we have to understand the file structure of different file types to identify the specific file through the data we see in a hex editor. However, we will not cover that in this room. What we will do, is to use a tool that does this work for us and identifies deleted files in a disk image file. But what is a disk image file?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Disk Image:</strong><br /><br />A disk image file is a file that contains a bit-by-bit copy of a disk drive. A bit-by-bit copy saves all the data in a disk image file, including the metadata, in a single file. Thus, while performing forensics, one can make several copies of the physical evidence, i.e., the disk, and use them for investigation. This helps in two ways. 1) The original evidence is not contaminated while performing forensics, and 2) The disk image file can be copied to another disk and analyzed without using specialized hardware.<br />Recovering files using Autopsy<br /><br />With that out of the way, let&#39;s see how we can recover deleted files from a disk. We will use <strong>Autopsy</strong> for recovering deleted files.</div>
