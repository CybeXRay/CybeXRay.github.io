Depending on their access levels, we can categorise a user in one of the following groups:</p><p></p><p><strong>Administrators</strong>	 → These users have the most privileges. They can change any system configuration parameter and access any file in the system.</p><p></p><p><strong>Standard Users</strong> → These users can access the computer but only perform limited tasks. Typically these users can not make permanent or essential changes to the system and are limited to their files.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Any user with administrative privileges will be part of the Administrators group. On the other hand, standard users are part of the Users group.</p><p>In addition to that, you will usually hear about some special built-in accounts used by the operating system in the context of privilege escalation:</p><p></p><p><strong>SYSTEM / LocalSystem</strong>	:	An account used by the operating system to perform internal tasks. It has full access to all files and resources available on the host with even higher privileges than administrators.</p><p></p><p><strong>Local Service</strong>					:	Default account used to run Windows services with &quot;minimum&quot; privileges. It will use anonymous connections over the network.</p><p></p><p><strong>Network Service</strong>				:	Default account used to run Windows services with &quot;minimum&quot; privileges. It will use the computer credentials to authenticate through the network.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Check Individual Sub Modules of Privilege Escalation Techniques</p></div>
