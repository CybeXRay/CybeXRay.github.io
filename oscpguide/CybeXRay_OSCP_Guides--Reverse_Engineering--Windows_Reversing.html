<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Windows Reversing</h1><br/>Using the <strong>IDA Free</strong> tool. <br /><br />The tool is beginner friendly and easy to use.<br /><br />Other good tools include <strong>x64dbg, Ghidra, WinDBG, Radare2, and of course GDB</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Static </strong>analysis involves looking at the program as it exists on disk; The program is never executed. Static requires you to guess or do detailed reverse engineering to figure it out.<br /><br /><strong>Dynamic </strong>analysis involves analyzing the process as it runs. Dynamic analysis is usually preferred unless dealing with malware. Dynamic analysis allows you to see data in memory and how it&#39;s being used.<br /><br /><br />There are three main functionalities that our tools will provide, those are <em><strong>debugging, disassembling, and decompiling</strong></em>. <br /><br /><strong>Disassemblers </strong>will translate the program from its bytes on disk or in memory into its assembly code equivalent and present it in an informative way. <strong>Decompilers </strong>are similar to disassemblers except instead of giving us the assembly, it attempts to recreate the code in C/C++. The downside to decompilers is that they can be inaccurate, or lack information. Because of this, if you&#39;re using a decompiler it&#39;s a good idea to have the disassembled code next to the decompiled code to check for inaccuracies. <strong>Debuggers</strong>, alongside disassemblers and decompilers, will allow us to place breakpoints within the program while it&#39;s running and analyze registers, memory, statuses, and more. They also allow for changing data in memory while the program is running.<br /><br /><br /></div>
