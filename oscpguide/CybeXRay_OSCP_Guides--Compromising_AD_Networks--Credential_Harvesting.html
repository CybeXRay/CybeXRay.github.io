We will be showing how to obtain, reuse, and impersonate user credentials. <br /><br />Credential harvesting consists of techniques for obtaining credentials like login information, account names, and passwords. It is a technique of extracting credential information from a system in various locations such as clear-text files, registry, memory dumping, etc. <br /><br />As a red teamer, gaining access to legitimate credentials has benefits:<br /><br />    • It can give access to systems (Lateral Movement).<br />    • It makes it harder to detect our actions.<br />    • It provides the opportunity to create and manage accounts to help achieve the end goals of a red team engagement.<br />    <br /><br /><strong><h3>Learning Objectives</h3></strong><br /><br />    • Understand the method of extracting credentials from local windows (SAM database)<br />    • Learn how to access Windows memory and dump clear-text passwords and authentication tickets locally and remotely.<br />    • Introduction to Windows Credentials Manager and how to extract credentials.<br />    • Learn methods of extracting credentials for Domain Controller<br />    • Enumerate the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) feature.<br />    • Introduction to AD attacks that lead to obtaining credentials.<br />    <br /><br /><strong>Credentials Harvesting</strong> is a term for gaining access to user and system credentials. It is a technique to look for or steal stored credentials, including network sniffing, where an attacker captures transmitted credentials. <br /><br />Credentials can be found in a variety of different forms, such as:<br /><br />    • Accounts details (usernames and passwords)<br />    • Hashes that include NTLM hashes, etc.<br />    • Authentication Tickets: Tickets Granting Ticket (TGT), Ticket Granting Server (TGS)<br />    • Any information that helps login into a system (private keys, etc.)<br /><br />Generally speaking, there are two types of credential harvesting: <strong>external</strong> and <strong>internal</strong>. External credential harvesting most likely involves phishing emails and other techniques to trick a user into entering his username and password. If you want to learn more about phishing emails, we suggest trying the <strong>THM Phishing room</strong>. Obtaining credentials through the internal network uses different approaches.<br /><br /><strong>In this room</strong>, the focus will be on harvesting credentials from an <strong>internal perspective </strong>where a threat actor has already compromised a system and gained initial access. <br /><br />We have provided a Windows Server 2019 configured as a Domain Controller. To follow the content discussed in this room, deploy the machine and move on to the next task.<br /><br />You can access the machine in-browser or through RDP using the credentials below.<br /><br /><strong>Machine IP: 10.10.209.28            Username: thm         Password: Passw0rd! </strong></div>
