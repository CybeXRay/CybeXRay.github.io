These programs and drivers include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. Autoruns reports Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more. Autoruns goes way beyond other autostart utilities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a good tool to search for any malicious entries created in the local machine to establish Persistence. </p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>:<strong> Autoruns.exe</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>ProcDump</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>ProcDump</strong> is a command-line utility whose primary purpose is monitoring an application for CPU spikes and generating crash dumps during a spike that an administrator or developer can use to determine the cause of the spike.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>:<strong> procdump.exe</strong> <strong>&lt;Process_Name&gt;</strong></p><p></p><p>Or</p><p></p><p>Alternatively, you can use <strong>Process Explorer</strong> to do the same.</p><p>Right-click on the process to create a Minidump or Full Dump of the process.</p><p></p><p><strong>Process Explorer </strong></p><p></p><p>The <strong>Process Explorer</strong> display consists of two sub-windows. The top window always shows a list of the currently active processes, including the names of their owning accounts, whereas the information displayed in the bottom window depends on the mode that Process Explorer is in: if it is in handle mode you&#39;ll see the handles that the process selected in the top window has opened; if Process Explorer is in DLL mode you&#39;ll see the DLLs and memory-mapped files that the process has loaded.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>:<strong> procexp.exe</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Process Hacker </strong>is a similar tool.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Process Monitor</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Process Monitor </strong>is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows that shows real-time file system, Registry and process/thread activity. It combines the features of two legacy Sysinternals utilities, Filemon and Regmon, and adds an extensive list of enhancements including rich and non-destructive filtering, comprehensive event properties such as session IDs and user names, reliable process information, full thread stacks with integrated symbol support for each operation, simultaneous logging to a file, and much more. Its uniquely powerful features will make Process Monitor a core utility in your system troubleshooting and malware hunting toolkit.</p><p></p><p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Command</span>:<strong> procmon.exe</strong></p><p></p><p>ProcMon will capture thousands upon thousands of events occurring within the operating system.</p><p>The option to capture events can be toggled on and off. </p><p></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To use ProcMon effectively you must use the Filter and must configure it properly.</p><p></p><p>Guide To Setup Process Monitor: <a href="https://adamtheautomator.com/procmon/">https://adamtheautomator.com/procmon/</a></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>PsExec</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>PsExec</strong> is a light-weight telnet-replacement that lets you execute processes on other systems, complete with full interactivity for console applications, without having to manually install client software.
