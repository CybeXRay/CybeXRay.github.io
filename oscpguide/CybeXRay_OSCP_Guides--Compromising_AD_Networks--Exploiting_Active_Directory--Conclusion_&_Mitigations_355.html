<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Conclusion & Mitigations</h1><br/><p><strong><h1>Conclusion &amp; Mitigations</h1></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Exploiting AD takes time to master, and the techniques used will highly depend on the configuration of the AD structure that is being attacked. The biggest thing to understand is that the process is cyclic. We will, in most cases, not be able to run a single boot-to-root exploit that gives us DA access. The best approach is to perform exploitation that furthers your access, then use the access that was achieved to perform enumeration again, looking for additional exploit paths that may be possible from this new position.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong><h2>Mitigations</h2></strong></p><p></p><p>AD exploitation, like AD enumeration, is incredibly hard to defend against. This is because what may be considered a misconfiguration that can be exploited, has an actual business case. However, we can do a couple of things to protect against exploitation:</p><p></p><p>    ▪ We need to ensure that no configuration breaks our tiering model. Accounts in a lower tier should not have the ability to interact with resources in a higher tier. Furthermore, accounts from a higher tier should never log onto resources in a lower tier.</p><p>    </p><p>    ▪ The principle of least privilege should be followed when permission delegation is performed. Furthermore, permission delegation should adhere to the tiering model, ensuring that a lower-tiered object can&#39;t alter a higher tiered object.</p><p>    </p><p>    ▪ SMB signing should be enforced, not just enabled. This will prevent credential relay attempts.</p><p>    </p><p>    ▪ AD objects and their configuration are not the only paths for exploitation. AD services, such as AD CS should also be considered part of the attack surface and secured.</p><p>    </p><p>    ▪ We need to implement sufficient security controls to protect Tier 0 infrastructure and accounts in our child domains since a compromise of one can lead to the compromise of the entire forest.</p></div>
