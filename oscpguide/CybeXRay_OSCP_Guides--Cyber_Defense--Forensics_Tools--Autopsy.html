Its plug-in architecture enables extensibility from community-developed or custom-built modules. Autopsy evolves to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of professionals in law enforcement, national security, litigation support, and corporate investigation.<br /><br /><br />Before diving into Autopsy and analyzing data, there are a few steps  to perform, such as identifying the data source and what Autopsy actions  to perform with the data source. <br /><br /><strong>Basic workflow:</strong><br />1. Create the case for the data source you will investigate<br />2. Select the data source you wish to analyze<br />3. Configure the ingest modules to extract specific artifacts from the data source<br />4. Review the artifacts extracted by the ingest modules<br />5. Create the report<br /><br /><br /><strong>Data Sources:</strong><br /><img src="images/298-1.png" alt="images/298-1.png" /><br /><br />we will focus primarily on the first option, Disk Image or VM file. <br /><br /><strong>Supported Disk Image Formats:</strong><br /><strong>    ▸Raw Single (For example: *.img, *.dd, *.raw, *.bin)<br />    ▸Raw Split (For example: *.001, *.002, *.aa, *.ab, etc)<br />    ▸EnCase (For example: *.e01, *.e02, etc)<br />    ▸Virtual Machines (For example: *.vmdk, *.vhd)<br /></strong><br />If there are multiple image files (e.i. E01, E02, E03, etc.) Autopsy only needs you to point to the first image file, and Autopsy will handle the rest.  <br /><br /><br /><strong>Ingest Modules:</strong><br /><br />Essentially Ingest Modules are Autopsy plug-ins. Each Ingest Module is designed to analyze and retrieve specific data from the drive. <br />Below is a screenshot of the Configure Ingest Modules window. <br /><br /><img src="images/298-2.png" alt="images/298-2.png" /><br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> If all the Ingest Modules are deselected, and <strong>Next</strong> is selected, Autopsy will still process the data source and update the local database. <br /><strong>Note:</strong> Autopsy adds metadata about files to the local database, not the actual file contents. <br /><br />The results of any Ingest Module you select to run against a data source will populate the Results node in the Tree view, which is the left pane of the Autopsy user interface. <br /><strong>Note:</strong> You can run Ingest Modules at any time while the case is open. To do so, right-click on the data source and select <strong>Run Ingest Modules.</strong> <br /><img src="images/298-3.png" alt="images/298-3.png" /><br /><br />As Ingest Modules run, alerts may appear in the <strong>Ingest Inbox</strong>. <br /><br /><strong><h2>User Interface:</h2></strong><br /><br />Let&#39;s look at the Autopsy user interface, which is comprised of 5 primary areas: <br /><br /><strong>    Tree Viewer (Left pane)<br />    Result Viewer (Top right pane)<br />    Keyword Search (Upper Top Right)<br />    Contents Viewer (Bottom right pane)<br />    Status Area (Lower Bottom right)</strong></div>
