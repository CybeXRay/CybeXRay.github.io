<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Redline</h1><br/><p><strong><h1>Redline</h1></strong></p><p></p><p>Many  tools can aid a security analyst or incident responder in performing  memory analysis on a potentially compromised endpoint. One of the most  popular tools is <strong><a href="https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/">Volatility</a></strong>,  which will allow an analyst to dig deep into the weeds when examining  memory artifacts from an endpoint. But this process can take time.  Often, when an analyst is triaging, time is of the essence, and the  analyst needs to perform a quick assessment to determine the nature of a  security event.</p><p></p><p></p><p>That is where the FireEye tool <strong><a href="https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/redline.html">Redline</a></strong> comes in. Redline will essentially give an analyst a 30,000-foot view (10 kilometers high view) of a Windows, Linux,  or macOS endpoint. Using Redline, you can analyze a potentially  compromised endpoint through the memory dump, including various file  structures. With a nice-looking GUI (Graphical User Interface) - you can  easily find the signs of malicious activities. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Here is what you can do using Redline:</p><p>• Collect registry data (Windows hosts only)</p><p>• Collect running processes</p><p>• Collect memory images (before Windows 10)</p><p>• Collect Browser History</p><p>• Look for suspicious strings</p><p>• And much more!</p><p></p><p></p><p>Installing Redline on your local machine is straightforward. Run the MSI file and follow the installation process.</p><p></p><p><strong><h3>Data Collection:</h3></strong></p><p></p><p>There are three ways or options to collect data using Redline: </p><p></p><p><img src="images/297-1.png" alt="images/297-1.png" /></p><p></p><p>1. <strong>Standard Collector</strong> - this method configures the script to gather a minimum amount of data for the analysis. This is going to be our preferred method to collect data in this room. It is also usually the fastest method to collect the data you need. It takes only a few minutes to complete.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Comprehensive Collector</strong> - this method configures the script to gather the most data from your host for further analysis. This method takes up to an hour or more. You will choose this method if you prefer the full analysis of the system.</p><p></p><p>3.<strong> IOC Search Collector (Windows only) </strong>- this method collects data that matches with the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that you created with the help of IOC Editor.  You will choose this method if you want to run the data collection  against known IOCs that you have gathered either through threat  intelligence (data feed or narrative report), incident response, or  malware analysis. You imported them into IOC Editor. </p><p></p><p>IOC Editor Link: <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/ioc-editor.html">https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/ioc-editor.html</a></p><p></p><p>IOC stands for <strong>Indicators of Compromise</strong>;  they are artifacts of the potential compromise and host intrusion on  the system or network that you need to look for when conducting threat  hunting or performing incident response. <strong>IOCs can be MD5, SHA1, SHA256  hashes, IP address, C2 domain, file size, filename, file path, a registry key, etc.</strong></p><p></p><p>One of the great tools you can use is <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/ioc-editor.html">IOC Editor, </a>created by FireEye, to create IOC files. You can refer to this link to learn how to use the IOC Editor: <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/freeware/ug-ioc-editor.pdf">https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/freeware/ug-ioc-editor.pdf</a>. </p><p></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: According to the <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/services/freeware/ioc-editor.html">IOC Editor</a> download page Windows 7 is the latest operating system officially supported. It is the same version installed in the attached VM. There is another tool called <a href="https://fireeye.market/apps/211404">OpenIOC Editor</a> by FireEye, which supports Windows 10 that is w</p></div>
