<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>traceroute</h1><br/><p><strong><h2>Traceroute</h2></strong></p><p></p><p> The logical follow-up to the ping command is &#39;traceroute&#39;. Traceroute can be used to map the path your request takes as it heads to the target machine.</p><p></p><p>The internet is made up of many, many different servers and end-points, all networked up to each other. This means that, in order to get to the content you actually want, you first need to go through a bunch of other servers. Traceroute allows you to see each of these connections -- it allows you to see every intermediate step between your computer and the resource that you requested. The basic syntax for traceroute on Linux is this: </p><p></p><p><strong>traceroute &lt;destination&gt;</strong></p><p></p><p>By default, the Windows traceroute utility (<strong>tracert</strong>) operates using the same <strong>ICMP protocol</strong> that ping utilises, and the Unix equivalent operates over <strong>UDP</strong>. This can be altered with switches in both instances.</p><p></p></div>
