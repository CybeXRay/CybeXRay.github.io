<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>john custom rules</h1><br/><strong><h1>John Custom Rules</h1></strong><br /><br />Mainly used for <strong>dictionary</strong> <strong>creation</strong> in<strong> single crack mode</strong>.<br /><br /><strong><h3>What are Custom Rules?</h3></strong><br /><br />As we journeyed through our exploration of what John can do in Single Crack Mode- you may have some ideas about what some good mangling patterns would be, or what patterns your passwords often use- that could be replicated with a certain mangling pattern. The good news is you can define your own sets of rules, which John will use to dynamically create passwords. This is especially useful when you know more information about the password structure of whatever your target is.<br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>Common Custom Rules</h3></strong><br /><br />Many organisations will require a certain level of password complexity to try and combat dictionary attacks, meaning that if you create an account somewhere, go to create a password and enter:<br /><br />polopassword<br /><br />You may receive a prompt telling you that passwords have to contain at least one of the following:<br /><br />    Capital letter<br />    Number<br />    Symbol<br /><br />This is good! However, we can exploit the fact that most users will be predictable in the location of these symbols. For the above criteria, many users will use something like the following:<br /><br />Polopassword1!<br /><br />A password with the capital letter first, and a number followed by a symbol at the end. This pattern of the familiar password, appended and prepended by modifiers (such as the capital letter or symbols) is a memorable pattern that people will use, and reuse when they create passwords. This pattern can let us exploit password complexity predictability.<br /><br />Now this does meet the password complexity requirements, however as an attacker we can exploit the fact we know the likely position of these added elements to create dynamic passwords from our wordlists.<br /><br /><br /><strong><h3>How to create Custom Rules</h3></strong><br /><br />Custom rules are defined in the john.conf file, usually located in <strong>/etc/john/john.conf</strong> if you have installed John using a package manager or built from source with make and in <strong>/opt/john/john.conf</strong> on the TryHackMe Attackbox.<br /><br />Let&#39;s go over the syntax of these custom rules, using the example above as our target pattern. Note that there is a massive level of granular control that you can define in these rules, I would suggest taking a look at the wiki here in order to get a full view of the types of modifier you can use, as well as more examples of rule implementation. <br /><br />The first line:<br /><br /><strong>[List.Rules:THMRules]</strong> - Is used to define the name of your rule, this is what you will use to call your custom rule as a John argument.<br /><br />We then use a regex style pattern match to define where in the word will be modified, again- we will only cover the basic and most common modifiers here:<br /><br /><strong>Az</strong> - Takes the word and appends it with the characters you define<br /><br /><strong>A0</strong> - Takes the word and prepends it with the characters you define<br /><br /><strong>c</strong> - Capitalises the character positionally<br /><br /><br />These can be used in combination to define where and what in the word you want to modify.<br /><br />Lastly, we then need to define what characters should be appended, prepended or otherwise included, we do this by adding character sets in square brackets <strong>[ ]</strong> in the order they should be used. These directly follow the modifier patterns inside of double quotes <strong>&quot; &quot;</strong>. Here are some common examples:<br /><br /><strong>[0-9] </strong>- Will include numbers 0-9<br /><br /><strong>[0] </strong>- Will include only the number 0<br /><br /><strong>[A-z] </strong>- Will include both upper and lowercase<br /><br /><strong>[A-Z] </strong>- Will include only uppercase letters<br /><strong><br />[a-z] </strong>- Will include only lowercase letters<br /><br /><strong>[a] </strong>- Will include only a<br /><br /><strong>[!£$%@] </strong>- Will include the symbols !£$%@<br /><br /><strong>Example:</strong><br />Putting this all together, in order to generate a wordlist from the rules that would match the example password &quot;Polopassword1!&quot; (assuming the word polopassword was in our wordlist) we would create a rule entry that looks like this:<br /><br /><strong>[List.Rules:PoloPassword]</strong><br /><br /><strong>cAz&quot;[0-9] [!£$%@]&quot;</strong><br /><br />In order to:<br /><br />Capitalise the first  letter - <strong>c</strong><br /><br />Append to the end of the word - <strong>Az</strong><br /><br />A number in the range 0-9 - <strong>[0-9]</strong><br /><br />Followed by a symbol that is one of <strong>[!£$%@]</strong><br /><br /><strong>Using Custom Rules</strong><br /><br />We could then call this custom rule as a John argument using the  <strong>--rule=PoloPassword</strong> flag.<br /><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><br />Command</span>: <strong>john --wordlist=[path to wordlist] --rule=PoloPassword [path to file]</strong><br /><br /><br /></div>
