<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Reconnaissance</h1><br/><p><strong><h1>Reconnaissance</h1></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>In a red team operation, you might start with no more than a company name, from which you need to start gathering information about the target. This is where reconnaissance comes into play. Reconnaissance (recon) can be defined as a preliminary survey or observation of your target (client) without alerting them to your activities. If your recon activities create too much noise, the other party would be alerted, which might decrease the likelihood of your success.</p><p></p><p>The tasks of this room cover the following topics:</p><p></p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Types of reconnaissance activities</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>WHOIS and DNS-based reconnaissance</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Advanced searching</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Searching by image</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Google Hacking</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Specialized search engines</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Recon-ng</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Maltego</p><p></p><p></p><p>Some specific objectives we&#39;ll cover include:</p><p></p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Discovering subdomains related to our target company</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Gathering publicly available information about a host and IP addresses</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Finding email addresses related to the target</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Discovering login credentials and leaked passwords</p><p>    <strong>• </strong>Locating leaked documents and spreadsheets</p><p></p><p>Reconnaissance can be broken down into two parts — passive reconnaissance and active reconnaissance, as explained in Task 2. In this room, we will be focusing on passive reconnaissance, i.e., techniques that don’t alert the target or create &#39;noise&#39;. In later rooms, we will use active reconnaissance tools that tend to be noisy by nature.</p></div>
