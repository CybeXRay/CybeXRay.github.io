<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>joomla version check</h1><br/><p>         </p><p><h1>How to Quickly Know the Version of any Joomla Website</h1></p><p>       </p><p>        Let’s say you want, for one reason or another (hopefully a good  reason), to know the version of a Joomla website that you don’t own. You  don’t have <em>FTP/sFTP</em> access to the site’s filesystem, you don’t have access to the backend, and you don’t know the owner. So, what do you do?</p><p>Well, for the absolute majority of Joomla websites, there is at least  one file that you can check that will tell you the exact version the  Joomla website is running.</p><p><strong>For Joomla websites &gt;= 1.6.0</strong></p><p>Joomla websites, ever since version 1.6.0, have a very easy method  that reveals their exact version (which may or may not be a good thing),  all you need to do is to access the following URL:</p><p><em>http://www.[thejoomlawebsite].com/administrator/manifests/files/joomla.xml</em></p><p>The above URL will display an XML file containing the site’s version in the <em>version</em> XML element.</p><p>Yes – it’s scarily easy, huh! It also applies to all versions of  Joomla from 1.6.0 until 3.6.3 (including, of course, all the versions in  the 2.5.x line), which is excellent!</p><p><strong>For Joomla websites &gt;= 1.5.0 and &lt;= 1.5.26</strong></p><p>Joomla websites in the 1.5.x line do not have the <em>joomla.xml</em> file, but there is another link that one can check, which is this one:</p><p><em>http://www.[thejoomlawebsite].com/language/en-GB/en-GB.xml</em></p><p>You can clearly see, in the XML <em>version</em> element, the version  of the Joomla website in question. However, the problem here is that  this method only reveals the major version, and not the minor version.  The minor version is typically guessed by checking some core JavaScript  files under the <em>media/system/js</em> folder.</p><p><strong>For Joomla websites &lt; 1.5.0</strong></p><p>Before you say anything, yes, there are still some Joomla websites on  the Internet using the 1.0.x versions (in fact, we worked on one back  on Sunday). In order to know if a Joomla website is version 1.0.x, then  all one needs to do is to check for the existence of a <em>custom.xml</em> file by visiting the following URL:</p><p><em>http://[thejoomlawebsite].com/modules/custom.xml</em></p><p>Similarly to the Joomla 1.5.x line, the Joomla 1.0.x line does not  have a straightforward method to accurately determine the minor version  of the Joomla website (for example, if it’s using version 1.0.0 or  version 1.0.15). However, JavaScript files in the <em>includes/js</em> folder typically reveal information (such as file revisions) that will help determine the minor version of the Joomla website.</p><p><strong>In short…</strong></p><p>• If the link <em>http://[thejoomlawebsite].com/modules/custom.xml</em> works: This is a Joomla 1.0.x website.</p><p>• If the link <em>http://www.[thejoomlawebsite].com/administrator/manifests/files/joomla.xml</em> works: This is a Joomla website with version &gt;= 1.6.0, and the exact version number is stored in the <em>version</em> XML element of the file.</p><p></p><p>• If none of the above links works, then the Joomla website is a 1.5.x website.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Again, the above assumes that you don’t have filesystem access to the  website. If you do have access to the filesystem, then you can check  the file <em>version.php</em> which tells you the exact version of the Joomla website. Unfortunately, the <em>version.php</em>  file is not present in a standard location. Luckily, however, you have  itoctopus on your side to let you know of its exact location for each  Joomla version:</p><p>◇ <strong>For Joomla 1.0.x websites</strong>: The file <em>version.php</em> is located under the <em>includes</em> folder.</p><p>◇ <strong>For Joomla 1.5.x and Joomla 1.6.x</strong>: The file <em>version.php</em> is located under the <em>libraries/joomla</em> folder.</p><p></p><p>◇ <strong>For the short lived Joomla 1.7.x</strong>: The file <em>version.php</em> is (oddly) located under the <em>includes</em> folder (which is similar to 1.0.x websites).</p><p></p><p>◇ <strong>For Joomla 2.5.x and Joomla 3.x</strong>: The file <em>version.php</em> is located under the <em>libraries/cms/version</em> folder.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>        </p></div>
